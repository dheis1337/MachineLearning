# Overview
This is a repository for the work I've done using the textbook _Machine Learning for Hackers_, which was co-authored by 
Drew Conway and John Myles White. I've gone through most of the chapters in the book and completed the examples 
and case studies involved. Here's a quick chapter-by-chapter rundown of the topics covered that I have completed. 

Chapter 3: Naive Bayes Classification
Chapter 5: Linear Regression
Chapter 6: Polynomial Regression, Cross Validation, and Regularization
Chapter 7: Optimization
Chapter 8: Principal Component Analysis
Chapter 9: Multidimensional Scaling
Chapter 10: k-Nearest Neighbor Classification
Chapter 12: Support Vector Machines

# Format
In each chapter's folders, you'll find my script for the examples in the book. You'll also find a /data folder that 
has all of the data associated with each chapter. Finally, there is a WRITEUP.md file which serves as a way for me 
to explain the technical aspects of the models introduced in each chapter. Check these WRITEUP.md files out if you 
want to see what I learned from completing each chapter.
