## Machine Learning
This repository is dedicated machine learning. In this repo you'll find some books
that I've used to teach myself machine learning as well as some projects I have 
done to practice some of the machine learning techniques I've learned. 


### Introduction to Statistical Learning
This is the seminal book on machine learning. It's a freely available book online
[here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). The book dives into the mathematics
behind some of the most popular topics in machine learning, which is why I think
it's one of the best books to learn machine learning. 

### Machine Learning for Hackers
This is a great book that touches on the actual application of popular machine 
learning algorithms. While I preferred ISL over this book, I think it provided a little
more information on machine learning's application on real data. 

### Machine Learning with R
This is another book that touches on the application of machine learning through 
guided examples. I put this book on the back burner to focus on ISL, so I could
get a stronger understanding of the theory behind machine learning.
