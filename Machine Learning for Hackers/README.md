# Overview
This is a repository for the work I've done using the textbook _Machine Learning for Hackers_, which was co-authored by 
Drew Conway and John Myles White. I've gone through most of the chapters in the book and completed the examples 
and case studies involved. Here's a quick chapter-by-chapter rundown of the topics covered that I have completed. Here is 
the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ML_for_Hackers) associated with the book.

# Chapters
3. Naive Bayes Classification
5. Linear Regression
6. Polynomial Regression, Cross Validation, and Regularization
7. Optimization
8. Principal Component Analysis
9. Multidimensional Scaling
10. k-Nearest Neighbor Classification
12. Support Vector Machines

# Format
In each chapter's folders, you'll find my script for the examples in the book. You'll also find a /data folder that 
has all of the data associated with each chapter. Finally, there is a WRITEUP.md file which serves as a way for me 
to explain the technical aspects of the models introduced in each chapter. Check these WRITEUP.md files out if you 
want to see what I learned from completing each chapter.
